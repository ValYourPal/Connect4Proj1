# Connect 4 1.0
In hindsight, I should've made a copy or something. I'm new to this...

This is basic Connect 4. This was my first project in JavaScript! 
I failed to include my sources the first time around so I didn't include any here to stay honest.

You can see my original commits from the original repo [here](https://github.com/ValYourPal/Connect4Proj2/commits/master) starting at "init commit" on Nov. 4 and ending at "final commit" on Nov. 9
